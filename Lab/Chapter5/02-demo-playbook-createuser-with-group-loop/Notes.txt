Handlers
- Handlers take action when called
- Handlers are called when a change is made.
- Handlers are called using the notify keyword
- More then one handler can be defined for a playbook or play
- mutliple handlers can be specified in the notify section
- Handlers can have multiple tasks.
- Regardless of how many tasks notify a handler, it will only run once.


Error Handling
 - Ignore errors by using the ignore_errors keywords
 - Force previosly notifed handler to run using the force_handlers keyword
 - define failure condotions using the failed_when
 - Override the "changed" status result using the changed_when keyword
 - Abort an entire play if any task fails using the any_errors_fatal keyword
 - Implement a block in order to logically group tasks and provide error handling using the following keywords:
	. block
 	. rescue
	. always 

Conditionals
	String -> Equal ==
        eg: ansible_machine == "x86_64"


	numaric -> Equal ==
        eg: max_memory == 512

        lessthen < , grather then >, lteq <=, gteq >=, not eq !=, 

        varaiable exists "is defined"
	varaiable not exists "is not defined"

Testing multiple Conditions
  when: ansible_distribution == "RedHat" or ansible_distribution == "Fedora"
  when: ansible_distribution_version == "8" and ansible_kernel == "4.18.0-80.el8.x86_64"

or --> Either one condition shd match 
and --> Two Conditions should match
